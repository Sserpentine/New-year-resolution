        <h2>My New Year resolution is to:</h2>

        <h2>because I want to remember all the fun times I had </h2></div>
        <p>I love new year because we get to celebrate the start of a new year and hope the year will be great. I hope that 2021 will have some more progress than 2020. I also hope that we can continue going out like how we did in 2019. I really miss all my friends and teachers and I really wish to visit them sometime. But, my biggest wish is that COVID-19 would go back to where it came from. It would be nice if you could fill the form given below to send me your resolution. After you are done click on the "Send me your resolution" button. <br> <span class="thankyou">Thank you!!</span>  </p>
